## Solution to the Linear Regression with OLS task in main.m
Solved in matlab.

### 1. 
Improved solution for counting and displaying basics statistics to matlab console
  
### 2.
Distribution of v(168) in file lognorm_dist.png. Distribution of v(168) is a log-normal distribution, what can be seen by plotting this distribution on logscale in x axis - which is a gaussian curve.
Distribution of logtransformed v(168) is a normal distribution. 
	
### 3
Plotting distribution of Log-transformed v(168) gives a gaussian curve, therefore, as gaussian curve is informally called bell curve - it indeed rings a bell.
  
### 5.
Correlation coefficients printed to console
  

### 10.
Final plot of mRSE in mRSE.png file. The multiple-input linear regression doesn't exactly look like expected,
	 therefore solution needs a double check. Properly adjusted regularization parameter could help.
